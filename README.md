# Object-Following-Robot

Designed and developed an object-following robot as part of a Computer Vision course project, leveraging the Jetson Nano platform and OpenCV library. The system uses live video feed to detect and track a target object in real-time, adjusting motor control to follow its movement. This project showcases the integration of AI-based vision with embedded hardware for intelligent robotic behavior.
